# Virtual Team Formation

## Purpose

Enable CEO and dimension leads to dynamically form virtual teams by selecting appropriate experts from the six dimensions based on project requirements, scope, and deliverables.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new client engagement
- A project requires expertise from multiple dimensions
- Forming a specialized team for a specific deliverable phase
- Scaling team up or down based on project needs
- Reorganizing team due to scope changes

## How It Works

### Step 1: Analyze Project Requirements

Review project requirements to determine:
- Project scope and complexity
- Required deliverables and milestones
- Timeline and urgency
- Budget and resource constraints
- Technical and domain expertise needed

### Step 2: Identify Required Dimensions

Determine which dimensions are needed:
- **Dimension 1 (Requirements)**: Always involved in discovery phase
- **Dimension 2 (Sales)**: For projects involving e-commerce, inventory, supply chain
- **Dimension 3 (Design)**: For projects requiring UI/UX, mock systems, visual design
- **Dimension 4 (Development)**: For projects requiring implementation, cloud deployment
- **Dimension 5 (Operations)**: For support functions (finance, legal, HR, customer service)
- **Dimension 6 (Innovation)**: For projects requiring training, AI capabilities, domain expertise

### Step 3: Select Dimension Leads

Engage dimension leads who will coordinate their teams:
- Requirements Director (if discovery/requirements phase)
- Sales Director (if business development or supply chain involved)
- Design Director (if design/mock system development)
- Tech Director (if development/cloud infrastructure)
- Operations Director (if operational support needed)
- Innovation Director (if learning/innovation component)

### Step 4: Select Specialists

Work with dimension leads to select specific experts:
- Match specialist expertise to project needs
- Consider specialist availability and capacity
- Ensure diversity of skills within team
- Balance senior and junior resources

### Step 5: Define Team Structure

Establish team organization:
- Assign virtual team lead (typically a dimension director)
- Define reporting lines and communication channels
- Establish meeting cadence and collaboration protocols
- Set decision-making authority and escalation paths

### Step 6: Conduct Team Kickoff

Initiate virtual team with:
- Project overview and objectives
- Roles and responsibilities clarification
- Deliverables and success criteria
- Timeline and milestones
- Communication and collaboration norms

## Team Formation Patterns

### Discovery-Only Team
**Purpose**: Requirements gathering and feasibility assessment
**Members**: Requirements Director + Requirements Analyst + Market Researcher + Requirements Consultant

### Design Mock Team
**Purpose**: Create mock systems and prototypes for client review
**Members**: Design Director + Page Designer + Frontend Designer + Visual Designer + relevant specialists

### Full Development Team
**Purpose**: Complete system implementation from requirements to deployment
**Members**: Multiple dimension leads + specialists from Requirements, Design, Development, Operations

### E-commerce Project Team
**Purpose**: Deliver complete e-commerce solution
**Members**: Requirements Director, Sales Director, Design Director (E-commerce Expert), Tech Director, Operations Director (Finance, Customer Service)

### Quick Win Team
**Purpose**: Small, fast deliverables
**Members**: 1-2 dimension leads + 2-4 specialists maximum

## Virtual Team Coordination

### Team Lead Responsibilities
- Coordinate day-to-day activities
- Track progress against milestones
- Resolve blockers and issues
- Report to CEO on team status
- Facilitate collaboration across specialists

### Communication Protocols
- Daily standups for active development
- Weekly status reviews with CEO
- Ad-hoc collaboration as needed
- Escalate issues promptly

### Deliverable Handoffs
- Requirements → Design: Requirements specification complete
- Design → Development: Design mockups and specs finalized
- Development → Operations: System deployed and tested
- Operations → Client: Deliverables packaged and documented

## Success Criteria

Virtual team formation succeeds when:
- Right expertise is assembled for project needs
- Team structure is clear and effective
- Collaboration is smooth across dimensions
- Deliverables are completed on time and with quality
- Team members understand roles and responsibilities
- Communication and escalation work effectively
