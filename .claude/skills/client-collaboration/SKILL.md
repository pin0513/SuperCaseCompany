## Communication Protocols

### Communication Channels
- **Formal meetings**: Project kickoffs, milestone reviews, presentations

- **Project portal**: Deliverable sharing, document repository

### Meeting Types

#### Kickoff Meeting
- **Purpose**: Align on project scope, timeline, and success criteria
- **Attendees**: CEO, dimension leads, client stakeholders
- **Agenda**: Introductions, project overview, roles and responsibilities, communication plan
- **Deliverable**: Kickoff deck, project charter

#### Discovery Session
- **Purpose**: Understand client needs, challenges, and requirements
- **Attendees**: Requirements Director, relevant specialists, client team
- **Agenda**: Current state review, pain points, desired outcomes, constraints
- **Deliverable**: Discovery summary, initial requirements draft

#### Design Review

### Communication Cadence
- **Daily**: Internal team standups (not with client)
- **Weekly**: Client status update email
- **Bi-weekly**: Progress review meeting (for active projects)
- **Monthly**: Strategic review (for ongoing engagements)
- **Ad-hoc**: As needed for urgent matters

## Expectation Management

### Setting Expectations
- Define clear scope and deliverables
- Establish realistic timelines
- Communicate what's included and excluded
- Clarify roles and responsibilities

### Managing Scope Changes
- Document all change requests
- Assess impact on timeline, budget, resources
- Present options and trade-offs
- Obtain formal approval before proceeding

### Addressing Delays
- Communicate delays as soon as identified
- Explain root cause transparently
- Propose mitigation plan
- Adjust expectations and timelines

## Feedback Management

### Gathering Feedback
- Use structured feedback forms
- Ask specific, actionable questions
- Provide context for feedback requests
- Set clear deadlines for feedback

### Feedback Questions
- What works well?
- What needs improvement?
- What's missing?
- What would you change?
- Does this meet your expectations?

### Processing Feedback
1. Collect all feedback systematically
2. Categorize by type (content, design, functionality)
3. Prioritize by impact and feasibility
4. Map feedback to requirements
5. Determine action plan
6. Communicate how feedback will be addressed

### Feedback Response Template
```
Thank you for your feedback on {deliverable}.

We've reviewed your comments and categorized them as follows:

Implemented:
- {Feedback item 1} → {How addressed}
- {Feedback item 2} → {How addressed}

Planned for next version:
- {Feedback item 3} → {Reason and timeline}

Clarification needed:
- {Feedback item 4} → {Question for client}

Out of scope:
- {Feedback item 5} → {Rationale and alternative}

We'll present the updated version on {date}.
```

## Win-Win Solution Design

### Identifying Win-Win Opportunities
- Understand client's true underlying needs (not just stated wants)
- Identify company's capabilities and constraints
- Find creative alternatives that satisfy both
- Look for long-term relationship benefits

### Trade-off Negotiation
When client wants exceed capabilities:
1. **Acknowledge**: Validate client's needs and goals
2. **Explain**: Share constraints or concerns transparently
3. **Explore**: Brainstorm alternative approaches together
4. **Propose**: Offer options with pros/cons
5. **Decide**: Collaborate on best path forward

### Example Win-Win Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: Client wants feature X, but it's complex and costly

**Win-Win Solution**:
- Implement simplified version X in initial release
- Prove value with analytics and user feedback
- Plan full version X for phase 2 if validated
- **Client wins**: Gets core functionality faster, reduces risk
- **Company wins**: Delivers on time, reduces complexity, sets up phase 2 work

**Scenario 2**: Client timeline is aggressive

**Win-Win Solution**:
- Prioritize must-have features for initial launch
- Deliver MVP on client timeline
- Plan subsequent releases for nice-to-have features
- **Client wins**: Launches on time with core value
- **Company wins**: Achievable timeline, staged work, ongoing engagement

## Conflict Resolution

### Common Conflicts
- Scope disagreements
- Timeline or budget overruns
- Quality expectations not met
- Communication breakdowns
- Misaligned priorities

### Resolution Process
1. **Listen**: Understand client's perspective fully
2. **Acknowledge**: Validate concerns without defensiveness
3. **Investigate**: Gather facts and context
4. **Collaborate**: Work together on solutions
5. **Commit**: Agree on action plan and follow through

### Escalation Path
1. Virtual team lead addresses directly with client
2. Dimension director escalates to CEO if unresolved
3. CEO engages client executive leadership
4. External mediation (rare, last resort)

### Upsell and Cross-sell

## Documentation

### Client-Facing Documents
- Proposals and contracts
- Requirements specifications
- Design presentations
- Status reports
- Final deliverables
- Training materials

### Internal Records
- Meeting minutes
- Decision logs
- Feedback summaries
- Relationship history

## Success Criteria

Client collaboration succeeds when:
- Client feels heard and understood
- Expectations are clear and aligned

## Example Usage

**Scenario**: Client wants mobile app, but budget only covers web app

**Collaboration Approach**:

```
Step 1: Understand True Need
- Why does client want mobile app? → Customers shop on mobile
- What's the core objective? → Enable mobile shopping experience

Step 2: Explore Alternatives
Option A: Responsive web app
- Works on mobile browsers
- Costs 40% less than native app
- Delivers 80% of mobile shopping value
- Can launch in timeline and budget

Option B: Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Feels like native app
- Works offline
- Costs 60% of native app
- Delivers 90% of mobile experience

Option C: Native app in Phase 2
- Deliver web app in Phase 1
- Validate with users and analytics
- Build native app in Phase 2 with data-driven decisions
- Reduces risk, spreads cost

Step 3: Present Options
Present all three options with pros/cons and costs

Step 4: Collaborate on Decision
Client chooses Option B (PWA)
- Gets mobile-optimized experience in budget
- Satisfies immediate need
- Keeps native app as future option

Win-Win Outcome:
✓ Client: Mobile shopping experience within budget and timeline
✓ Company: Achievable scope, happy client, potential Phase 2 work
✓ End Users: Great mobile experience

Relationship strengthened through collaborative problem-solving
