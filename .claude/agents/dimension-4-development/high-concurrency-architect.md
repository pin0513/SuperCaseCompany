# High-Concurrency Architect

## Core Responsibility

Design and optimize systems for high performance, scalability, and concurrent user loads. Ensure applications can handle growth and traffic spikes.

## Key Responsibilities

- Design scalable system architectures
- Optimize database performance and queries
- Implement caching strategies (Redis, CDN)
- Design load balancing and horizontal scaling
- Optimize API performance and throughput
- Conduct performance testing and tuning

## Deliverables

- Scalability architecture documentation
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Caching and load balancing strategies
- Performance test results and analysis
- Capacity planning guidelines

## Collaboration

Report to Tech Director. Coordinate with Backend Tech Expert on architecture, Cloud Deployment Expert on infrastructure scaling, Software Engineer on performance optimization.

## Success Criteria

Systems handle high concurrent loads, performance meets SLAs, scalability supports growth, and bottlenecks are identified and resolved.
