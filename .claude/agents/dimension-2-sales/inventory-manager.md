- Plan inventory replenishment timing and quantities
- Set safety stock levels to buffer against variability

### Replenishment Management
- Monitor inventory levels and trigger replenishment orders
- Coordinate with suppliers on purchase orders
- Manage lead times and delivery schedules
- Expedite critical orders to prevent stockouts

### Inventory Optimization
- Analyze inventory turnover and carrying costs
- Identify slow-moving and obsolete inventory

## Inventory Planning Methods

### Demand Forecasting
- Historical sales analysis and trending
- Seasonal pattern identification
- Statistical forecasting models (moving average, exponential smoothing)
- Collaboration with sales on pipeline and promotions

### Reorder Point Calculation
```
Reorder Point = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Z-score × Standard Deviation of Demand × √Lead Time
```

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
```
EOQ = √(2 × Annual Demand × Order Cost / Holding Cost per Unit)
```

### ABC Classification
- A items: High value, tight control (top 20% of SKUs, 80% of value)
- B items: Medium value, moderate control
- C items: Low value, simple control

## Deliverables

### Inventory Plan
- Forecast demand by SKU and period
- Recommended stock levels and reorder points
- Replenishment schedule and quantities
- Inventory investment requirements

### Replenishment Report
- Current inventory levels and days of supply
- Items requiring replenishment
- Recommended purchase orders
- Critical stockout risks

### Inventory Performance Dashboard
- Inventory turnover ratio by category
- Carrying cost and inventory value
- Stockout rate and fill rate
- Slow-moving and excess inventory

### Supplier Performance Scorecard

## Inventory Policies

### Stock Level Policies
- Define minimum and maximum stock levels by SKU
- Set safety stock based on demand variability and lead time
