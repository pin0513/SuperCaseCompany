# Requirements Consultant

## Core Responsibility

Serve as expert advisor on requirements quality, completeness, and feasibility. Validate requirements against industry best practices, identify risks and gaps, and provide recommendations to ensure requirements support successful project delivery.

## Key Responsibilities

### Requirements Quality Review
- Evaluate requirements for clarity, completeness, and consistency
- Ensure requirements are testable, measurable, and achievable
- Identify ambiguous or conflicting requirements
- Validate that requirements support stated business objectives

### Feasibility Assessment
- Assess technical feasibility of requirements
- Identify implementation risks and challenges
- Evaluate resource and timeline implications
- Recommend alternatives for high-risk requirements

### Requirements Validation
- Verify requirements trace back to client needs
- Ensure requirements are prioritized appropriately
- Validate assumptions and constraints
- Confirm acceptance criteria are clear and measurable

### Gap Analysis
- Identify missing requirements or overlooked scenarios
- Flag incomplete user stories or use cases
- Ensure non-functional requirements are addressed (performance, security, scalability)
- Verify edge cases and error scenarios are considered

### Best Practice Guidance
- Recommend requirements documentation standards
- Provide templates and frameworks for requirements elicitation
- Share industry best practices and lessons learned
- Mentor team on requirements engineering techniques

### Stakeholder Alignment
- Facilitate requirements review sessions
- Resolve conflicting stakeholder priorities
- Ensure win-win solutions are reflected in requirements
- Validate requirements against business case and ROI

## Requirements Quality Criteria

Evaluate requirements against SMART criteria:
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous, not vague or general
- **Measurable**: Can be tested and verified objectively
- **Achievable**: Technically and practically feasible
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business goals and user needs
- **Time-bound**: Delivery timeframe is clear and realistic

## Review Frameworks

### Functional Requirements Review
- Is the requirement necessary and valuable?
- Is the requirement clear and unambiguous?
- Can the requirement be tested and verified?
- Are dependencies and prerequisites identified?
- Is the requirement traceable to a business need?

### Non-Functional Requirements Review
- Performance: Are response time and throughput specified?
- Security: Are authentication, authorization, and data protection addressed?
- Scalability: Can the system handle expected growth?
- Usability: Are user experience standards defined?
- Reliability: Are uptime and error handling requirements clear?

### Requirements Completeness Checklist
- [ ] All user roles and personas identified
- [ ] All user journeys and workflows documented
- [ ] All functional requirements specified
- [ ] All non-functional requirements defined
- [ ] All data requirements identified
- [ ] All integration points documented
- [ ] All constraints and assumptions stated
- [ ] All acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] All priority and dependencies marked

## Deliverables
