## Industry Scenarios to Address

### Shift Scheduling
```
Scenario: Restaurant needs to schedule 20 staff across 3 shifts
- Morning prep (6am-11am): 3 kitchen, 1 manager
- Lunch service (11am-3pm): 5 kitchen, 8 front-of-house, 1 manager
- Dinner service (5pm-11pm): 6 kitchen, 10 front-of-house, 1 manager
- Closing cleanup (11pm-12am): 2 kitchen, 2 front-of-house

Constraints:
- No staff work >8 hours/day without overtime approval
- Minors (16-17) cannot work past 10pm
- Each shift must have certified food handler
- Manager must overlap 30min between shifts
```

### Chain Management
```
Scenario: Chain with 15 locations needs centralized reporting
- Daily sales and labor cost reports from each store
- Weekly inventory and waste reports
- Monthly P&L comparison across locations
- Real-time alerts for performance anomalies
- Consolidated supplier orders with location delivery

Dashboard Requirements:
- Store manager view: Own location only
- Regional manager view: 5 locations comparison
- CEO view: All locations, trends, outliers
```

### Central Kitchen
```
Scenario: Central kitchen supplies 10 restaurant locations
- Menu planning determines ingredient needs
- Forecast based on historical sales + events
- Orders placed to suppliers 3 days ahead
