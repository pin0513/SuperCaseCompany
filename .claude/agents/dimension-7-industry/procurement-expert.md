## Procurement Scenarios to Address

### Supplier Selection
```
Scenario: Coffee shop client needs green coffee bean supplier
Requirements:
- Specialty grade Arabica beans
- Single-origin and blend options
- Monthly volume: 500kg
- Direct trade or certified sustainable
- Consistent quality and supply

Supplier Options:
1. Taiwan Coffee Roasters (local roaster, imports and roasts)
   - Price: $12/kg (roasted)
   - MOQ: 50kg per order
   - Lead time: 1 week
   - Quality: High, consistent
   - Certifications: Fair Trade

2. Colombia Direct Trade Cooperative
   - Price: $6/kg (green beans, FOB)
   - MOQ: 500kg per shipment
   - Lead time: 6 weeks (shipping)
   - Quality: Very high, seasonal variation
   - Certifications: Direct Trade, Organic

Landed Cost Analysis:
Option 1: $12/kg (roasted, delivered)
Option 2: $6 + $1.50 (freight) + $0.50 (tariff) + $2 (roasting) = $10/kg

Recommendation:
Option 2 (Colombia Direct Trade) if client has roasting capability
- 16.7% cost savings
- Higher quality and direct trade story
- Requires roasting investment and inventory planning
```

### Import Logistics
```
Scenario: Restaurant chain imports Italian espresso machines
Product: Commercial espresso machine
Quantity: 20 units
FOB Price: EUR 3,000 each
Origin: Italy
Destination: Taiwan

Import Analysis:
1. HS Code: 8419.81 (Coffee or tea makers)
2. Tariff Rate: 5% CIF
3. Freight Cost: EUR 500 per unit (air freight)
4. Insurance: 1% of CIF value
5. Customs Clearance: TWD 5,000 per shipment

Landed Cost Calculation:
FOB: EUR 3,000 x 20 = EUR 60,000
Freight: EUR 500 x 20 = EUR 10,000
CIF: EUR 70,000

Tariff (5%): EUR 70,000 x 5% = EUR 3,500
Insurance (1%): EUR 70,000 x 1% = EUR 700
Customs Clearance: TWD 5,000 / 30 (EUR/TWD) = EUR 167

Total Landed Cost: EUR 74,367 / 20 = EUR 3,718 per unit

Timeline:
- Order to shipment: 4 weeks (manufacturing lead time)
- Shipping: 2 weeks (air freight)
- Customs clearance: 3-5 days
- Total: 6-7 weeks
