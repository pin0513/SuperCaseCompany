- Unit Price: $1.20/kg (volume tier: 5,000+ kg)
- Total: $12,000

Order Workflow:
1. Customer places order via portal
2. System checks credit limit (customer has $50k limit, $30k used)
3. System checks inventory (12 tons available)

### Commodity Pricing
```
Scenario: Coffee bean pricing fluctuates with market

- Margin: Cost-plus 15%
- Volume Discount: >1000kg = -5%, >5000kg = -10%
- Contract Pricing: Locked price for 6 months (volume commitment)

Price Calculation:
Market Price: $4.50/kg (today)
Cost-Plus: $4.50 * 1.15 = $5.18/kg
Volume Discount (3000kg order): $5.18 * 0.95 = $4.92/kg
Contract Price (if applicable): $4.80/kg (locked 3 months ago)

System Requirements:

- Tainan Depot: 2 tons available
- Kaohsiung Depot: 10 tons available
- Taipei Depot: 8 tons available

Order Routing Options:
1. Split delivery: 2 tons from Tainan + 3 tons from Kaohsiung
2. Full delivery from Kaohsiung (higher freight cost)
3. Transfer from Kaohsiung to Tainan (lead time)

System Recommendation:
