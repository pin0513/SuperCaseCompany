# Deliverable Standards

## Applicability

Applies to: All team members creating deliverables (documents, designs, code, reports)

## Core Principle

Every deliverable must be of professional quality, ready for client presentation, and meeting defined acceptance criteria before submission.

## Universal Quality Standards

All deliverables, regardless of type, must meet:

### Completeness
- All required sections or components are included
- No placeholders or "TBD" items remain
- Supporting materials (appendices, references) are attached
- File naming and organization follow conventions

### Accuracy
- Information is factually correct and validated
- Data and metrics are verified
- References and citations are accurate
- Technical specifications are implementable

### Clarity
- Content is clear and understandable to intended audience
- Language is concise and free of jargon (unless defined)
- Structure is logical and easy to navigate
- Visual aids enhance rather than confuse

### Consistency
- Formatting follows company templates
- Terminology is used consistently throughout
- Style and tone are appropriate and uniform
- Branding elements are applied correctly

### Professionalism
- Free of spelling and grammar errors
- Polished visual presentation
- Appropriate level of detail
- Ready for client viewing without revision

### Traceability
- Linked to requirements and decisions
- Version number and status clearly marked
- Change history documented
- Ownership and contributors identified

## Review and Approval Process

### Self-Review
Before submitting for review:
1. **Completeness check**: All sections present
2. **Proofread**: Spelling, grammar, formatting
3. **Quality check**: Meets deliverable-specific standards
4. **Traceability**: Requirements linked
5. **Version**: Number and status updated

### Peer Review (Optional)
For complex or high-risk deliverables:
- Peer specialist reviews content and approach
- Provides feedback and suggestions
- Creator incorporates feedback
- Peer approves or requests additional changes

### Dimension Lead Review
All deliverables reviewed by dimension lead:
1. **Content review**: Accuracy and completeness
2. **Quality review**: Professional standards met
3. **Alignment review**: Matches requirements and objectives
4. **Feedback**: Specific, actionable comments
5. **Approval or revision**: Approve or request specific changes

### CEO Review (for major deliverables)
Strategic deliverables reviewed by CEO:
- Requirements specifications
- Design proposals (before client presentation)
- Technical architecture (major decisions)
- Final project deliverables
- Client presentations

### Client Review
Client-facing deliverables:
1. **Package**: Organize all materials
2. **Present**: Walk through with context
3. **Gather feedback**: Systematic collection
4. **Iterate**: Incorporate client input
5. **Approve**: Obtain client sign-off

## Revision and Version Control

### Version Numbering
Follow semantic versioning: `{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}-{Status}`
- Major: Significant changes or restructuring
- Minor: Additions or refinements
- Patch: Small fixes or clarifications
- Status: draft, review, client, approved, final

### Change Tracking
Document changes between versions:
```
Version 2.1.0-revised (changes from 2.0.0-client)
- Section 3: Added payment gateway comparison
- Section 5: Updated timeline based on client feedback
- Appendix A: Added competitive analysis
- Throughout: Clarified mobile app scope
```

### Archiving
- Maintain version history
- Archive approved versions
- Delete draft versions after final approval
- Organize by client/project/deliverable type

## Common Issues and How to Avoid Them

| Issue | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Incomplete deliverables | Use checklist, review before submission |
| Spelling/grammar errors | Proofread, use spell-check, peer review |
| Inconsistent formatting | Use templates, review against standards |
| Missing traceability | Link to requirements during creation |
| Unclear content | Write for audience, have peer review |
| Late submissions | Plan time for review and revision |
| Technical errors | Validate data, test code, verify facts |
