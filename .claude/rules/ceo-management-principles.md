## Applying the Five Pillars

### For Strategic Decisions

Evaluate every major decision through all five lenses:

**Example: Adopt new design tool (Figma vs. Adobe XD)**

| Pillar | Consideration | Assessment |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| 產 (Production) | Will it improve design quality and speed? | +2 (Collaboration features improve efficiency) |
| 銷 (Sales) | Does it enhance client presentations? | +1 (Client can view and comment on designs) |
| 人 (Human) | Do designers know it? Training needed? | -1 (Learning curve, but industry standard) |
| 發 (R&D) | Is it modern and future-proof? | +2 (Industry-leading, active development) |
| 財 (Finance) | What's the cost vs. current tool? | 0 (Similar pricing to current tool) |
| **Total** | **Overall assessment** | **+4 (Strong positive, proceed)** |

### For Project Evaluation

Assess every project opportunity:

**Example: E-commerce website project**

```
產 (Production):
✓ Within our capabilities (Design + Development dimensions)
✓ Similar to past projects (knowledge reuse)
⚠ Tight timeline (need to form strong virtual team)

銷 (Sales):
✓ High-value client (enterprise)
✓ Potential for ongoing support and enhancements
✓ Reference client in e-commerce vertical

人 (Human):
✓ Team has e-commerce expertise
⚠ Peak season (resource availability tight)
✓ Good learning opportunity for junior developers

發 (R&D):
✓ Opportunity to use new framework (Next.js)
✓ AI recommendation engine component
✓ Builds modern e-commerce capability

財 (Finance):
✓ Strong margins (60%+ target achievable)
✓ Payment terms acceptable (30-60-90)
⚠ Upfront investment in infrastructure setup

Decision: APPROVE - Strong fit across all pillars. Address resource availability and timeline with careful virtual team formation.
```

### For Crisis Management

When problems arise, diagnose using five pillars:

**Example: Project running behind schedule**

```
產 (Production):
Root Cause: Requirements changed mid-project, design iterations excessive
Action: Freeze scope, accelerate design approval

銷 (Sales):
Impact: Client relationship at risk, potential revenue loss
Action: CEO engage client, negotiate timeline extension

人 (Human):
Impact: Team working overtime, morale declining
Action: Add resources to virtual team, recognize efforts

發 (R&D):
Impact: No time for innovation, using old patterns
Action: Accept for this project, plan innovation in next project

財 (Finance):
Impact: Fixed-price contract, margin eroding
Action: Negotiate change order for scope changes, control costs

Integrated Solution:
1. CEO negotiates 2-week extension with client (銷)
2. Freeze scope, fast-track approvals (產)
3. Add one developer to virtual team (人)
4. Accept margin reduction for this project, learn for next (財)
5. Document lessons learned for future (發)
```

## Monthly CEO Review

### 銷 (Sales) Metrics
