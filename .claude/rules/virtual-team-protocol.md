# Virtual Team Protocol

## Applicability

Applies to: All team members participating in virtual teams, including dimension leads and specialists

## What is a Virtual Team

A virtual team is a temporary, cross-functional team assembled from specialists across the six dimensions to deliver specific project outcomes. Virtual teams:
- Are **project-specific**: Formed for a specific engagement or deliverable
- Are **cross-dimensional**: Include members from multiple dimensions
- Are **temporary**: Dissolve when project completes
- Have **clear leadership**: One dimension lead serves as virtual team lead
- Have **defined deliverables**: Specific outputs and success criteria

## Virtual Team Formation

### CEO Initiates
CEO analyzes project and determines:
- Which dimensions are needed
- Which specialists should participate
- Who should lead the virtual team
- Project scope, timeline, and deliverables

### Dimension Leads Coordinate
Dimension leads:
- Confirm specialist availability
- Brief specialists on project context
- Set boundaries for specialist time commitment
- Commit to supporting virtual team

### Virtual Team Lead Appointed
One dimension director serves as virtual team lead, responsible for:
- Coordinating day-to-day team activities
- Tracking progress and deliverables
- Facilitating team collaboration
- Reporting status to CEO
- Escalating blockers

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

## Collaboration Best Practices

### Cross-Dimension Handoffs
When one specialist's work depends on another:
1. **Communicate dependencies**: Make needs clear early
