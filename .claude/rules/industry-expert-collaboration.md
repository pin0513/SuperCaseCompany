# Industry Expert Collaboration Protocol

## Applicability

Applies to: All six industry experts, procurement expert, Industry Consulting Director, and all team members collaborating with Dimension 7

## Core Principle

Industry experts provide domain-specific insights to ensure IT solutions align with operational realities, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. Collaboration must be proactive, actionable, and integrated throughout project lifecycle.

## When Industry Experts Engage

### Virtual Team Formation
Industry Consulting Director assigns industry expert when:
- Client operates in a covered sector (restaurant, breakfast, beverage, raw material, cold chain, coffee)
- Requirements involve industry-specific operations (shift scheduling, chain management, central kitchen)
- Compliance with industry regulations is critical
- Solution must integrate with industry-standard systems (POS, suppliers, logistics)

### Throughout Project Lifecycle
Industry experts actively participate in:
- **Requirements Phase**: Validate operational feasibility and industry compliance
- **Design Phase**: Ensure UI/UX aligns with industry workflows
- **Development Phase**: Clarify business logic and integration needs
- **Testing Phase**: Provide industry-specific test scenarios
- **Deployment Phase**: Validate solution against industry benchmarks

|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| "We'll add industry expert at the end" | Too late to fix fundamental issues | Engage from requirements phase |
| "Industry expert provides vague feedback" | Team cannot act on general comments | Provide specific, actionable recommendations |
| "Team ignores industry expert concerns" | Solution doesn't work in real operations | Treat industry insights as requirements |
| "Industry expert reviews once, disappears" | Issues discovered too late | Industry expert participates throughout |
| "No documentation of industry insights" | Knowledge lost, repeated questions | Document all industry guidance |
